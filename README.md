## Design Choices

The style will be based on a minimalistic and simplicity approach that shows of the designer's
projects and make it more eye catching, a website that is subtle with good readability also an easy flow and navigation.
As this is a personal portfolio for the designer, the main inspiration and 
decisions will come from the designer own personal designs.

### Colour Scheme
The colour scheme are mostly muted tones to give the subtleness to the website and also to make the images stand out.

![colour scheme](docs/wireframe/colour-scheme.jpg)
* #F2F2F2 Light Gray - Primary background-colour use to bring attention to design 
elements, good for dark on light designs.
* #E7E1D3 Beige - Secondary background-colour can go well with lighter tone images.
* #FDEADD Pale Orange - Overlay colour on buttons when hovered or selected and call-to-actions buttons.
* #5B5B5B Dark Gray - Header and text colour use on light designs.

### Typography 
To keep a modern style and for easy readability, the font used are Montserrat for headings
and Raleway for general text with Sans Serif as the fallback font incase for any reason the font isn't being
imported into the site correctly. These are taken from [Google](https://fonts.google.com/?preview.size=26&preview.text_type=custom&preview.text=TESSA%20CHAN) fonts library.

### Icon
I have decided to implement icons, using the [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) library.
The icons are designer's social media, a back-to-top arrow and hamburger icon for smaller media.

### Imagery
Imagery is important for a graphic designer portfolio, so choosing good images will
catch the users attention. All of the projects, logo and private owned images are from 
the site owner and the portrait used are the site owner photo.

### Structure
This website will consist three seperate pages a homepage (index.html), projects page,
about page and a contact form and also a link to download CV and pricelist.
I have will be using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) to create an overall structure 
for the website, a Modal component to create the contact form and Carousel component for images for 
the homepage, the navigation bar will also be fixed on top. A responsive design will be added to the navbar and on small/mobile devices it will
condense into a hamburger icon that will have a toggle to view the nav menu and its associated links.
This will save screen space and keep to conventions users are expecting.
 
# Wireframes
The wireframes are created by using the program [Balsamic](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/). I created the mobile 
wireframe first so I get a rough idea what I want it to look like on a small media then moved onto tablet then desktop.
